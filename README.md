# Mobile Vision

This repository includes code examples, tools, and documentation to help developers create mobile computer vision applications using Flutter. Currently, there are two sample applicationsâ€”one for image classification and the other for object detection. The tools directory includes converters and label files.

Sample applications use YOLO models. YOLO models and related documentation can be found on Ultralytics web site: https://www.ultralytics.com

The inference is done using the tflite_flutter plugin. The plugin can be gathered from pub.dev: https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter
